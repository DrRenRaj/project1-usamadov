The App is called "Fastest Vehicles in the world". The reason behind this is project is because of my passion about cars. 
I constantly read or watch videos on every new super car thats comes out and wanted to share that information with others.
First Activity is Login page where user puts login and password.
Once login and password is correct, user is navigated to Main Page where it displays three categories of fastes vehicles.
"Combustion Engine cars"
"Electric Cars"
"Motorycles"
User can click on any desired category and it will take you to a list of top 10 fastest cars on category chosen.
Once a car picked out of 10, then, user can chose a car they want to read the information about a particular vehicle. 
User can learn about where vehicle is manufactured and learn about its performance.
